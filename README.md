Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a static website for a “Rolling Stones” band. This band is a 1960’s rock band and has around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. I would like highlight that   creating of the website were oriented to primary target audiences - their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear best clips from band,  enjoy from seeing photos of the band members from their music life and  read the “Rolling Stones” latest news and any new material as it becomes available.
Furthermore, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings, private events or parties. For these reasons the website includes a booking form.
In additional, there you can find a subscribe form to be aware the latest band news and offers.
Also, fans can enjoy their creativity in the social media pages such as   Facebook, Spotify, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube.


## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://gannasachkova.github.io/mini_project_1/).

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. The dark colour scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.

For fans, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of “Rolling Stones” band and their capabilities via a user friendly design. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who they are, their background, what work they've done, and with additional option to contact them if they would like to invite the band to the private events, weddings or corporates to share their happiness.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)


## Features
This site uses the Bootstrap  features. The navbar  stays collapsed only the extra-small screen size. All images and video on the website  are responsive.

### It remains to implement
In the future, I would like to  create a new  additional comprehensive section “live concerts / available tickets”. I would also like to JavaScript function to create a "smooth" transition between site pages.

## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.



All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.
